# SMWG-reference-arch

A reference architecture for monitoring of Cray supercomputers

Modern HPC systems are comprised of many interacting subsystems with very high
component counts, making it difficult to determine:
 - Whether the system is healthy
 - Which components contribute to some observed problem
 - How effectively the system is being utilized 

There are many sources of system data (logs,sensors, performance counters for 
individual components). This project aims to describe a reference architecture 
for collecting, processing, storing and analyzing data in a way that helps HPC
center staff identify and prevent system problems and to decide where to 
concentrate resources in order to best optimize usage of the system
